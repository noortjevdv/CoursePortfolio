#For my corpus, I will use two of the playlists that spotify made for me. The first playlist is “Jouw topnummers van 2020” and the second playlist is “Jouw topnummers van 2021”. 
What I find interesting about these playlists is that they are in some way representative of the music that I listened to in 2020 and 2021. I’m interested in seeing if there are specific things that have changed when it comes to my music taste. I think the tracks in these playlists are quite representative when it comes to the music that I listened to during those periods of time. 


Some typical tracks from the 2020 playlist:

Why Why Why Why Why - Sault

Colors - Black Pumas
